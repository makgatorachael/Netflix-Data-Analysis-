# Netflix-Data-Analysis-
Netflix is a one of the world's leading subscription-based streaming service that allows members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device. I am using power BI to analyse the data that I got from Kaggle to gain insights and explore patterns within movies and tv shows available on Netflix from 1925 to 2020.

The data that I have contains show id, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre and description.

During my analysis I found out that there are more movies than TV shows. The genre kidsâ€™ TV, consist of only the TV shows and most of them are three seasons long. The United States produces more TV shows and movies than any other country. In the late 90s and early 2000s is where we see the booming of movies and TV shows production. There are more movies produced than the tv shows on average. The genre documentaries has more movies than any other genre. Most Netflix content is suitable for adults.
